Jul 10 23:21:55.615 [warn] ControlPort is open, but no authentication method has been configured.  This means that any program on your computer can reconfigure your Tor.  That's bad!  You should upgrade your Tor controller as soon as possible.

Jul 10 23:22:15.000 [notice] I learned some more directory information, but not enough to build a circuit: We need more microdescriptors: we have 0/6934, and can only build 0% of likely paths. (We have 0% of guards bw, 0% of midpoint bw, and 0% of end bw (no exits in consensus, using mid) = 0% of path bw.)
